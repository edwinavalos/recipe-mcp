# Team 4 MCP Server Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**STATUS**: 🎯 DELIVERED  
**COORDINATION**: Ready for Team 3 browser automation integration  
**TIMESTAMP**: 2025-08-20 05:07 UTC  

## Implementation Summary

Team 4 has successfully implemented the complete MCP server infrastructure with full compliance integration, delivering all required components for recipe extraction with legal oversight and rate limiting.

### ✅ Core Deliverables Complete

#### 1. Enhanced Data Models (`recipe_mcp/models.py`)
```python
# New compliance-aware data structures
- Recipe: Restructured with compliance tracking and enhanced metadata
- Ingredient: Advanced parsing with grocery list grouping support  
- ComplianceInfo: Tracking daily usage, rate limits, session management
- ComplianceStatus: Enum for compliance states (COMPLIANT, RATE_LIMITED, etc.)
- ExtractionResult: Extended with compliance information integration
```

#### 2. FastMCP Server Implementation (`recipe_mcp/server.py`)
```python
# Four core MCP tools implemented:
1. extract_recipe: Main extraction with @ensure_compliance() decorator
2. validate_url: URL validation for supported recipe sites
3. get_compliance_status: Real-time compliance monitoring
4. get_daily_usage: Usage statistics and limits tracking
```

#### 3. Compliance Framework (`recipe_mcp/compliance.py`)
```python
# Complete legal oversight system:
- ComplianceMonitor: Daily limits (50/day), rate limiting (10/min)
- ComplianceHTTPSession: Respectful web scraping with delays
- ensure_compliance(): Decorator for automatic compliance checking
- Usage tracking with session management
```

### 🔧 Technical Integration Points

#### For Team 3 (Browser Automation):
```python
# Ready integration interface:
from recipe_mcp.compliance import ensure_compliance, ComplianceHTTPSession

@ensure_compliance()
async def your_extraction_function(url: str):
    # Your browser automation code here
    # Compliance is automatically enforced
    pass

# Use ComplianceHTTPSession for respectful requests
async with ComplianceHTTPSession() as session:
    response = await session.get(url)
```

#### MCP Tool Specifications:
```json
{
  "extract_recipe": {
    "input": {"url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/...", "include_nutrition": true},
    "output": {"success": true, "recipe": {...}, "compliance_info": {...}}
  },
  "validate_url": {
    "input": {"url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/..."},
    "output": {"valid": true, "site": "NYT Cooking", "requires_subscription": true}
  },
  "get_compliance_status": {
    "output": {"status": "compliant", "daily_usage": {...}, "server_health": "healthy"}
  }
}
```

### 📊 Quality Metrics Achieved

- **Pydantic V2**: Fully migrated with proper validation
- **Type Safety**: Complete type annotations throughout
- **Compliance**: Daily limits and rate limiting operational
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery implemented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all functions

### 🔄 Integration Status

- **Team 1 Infrastructure**: Fully integrated with existing project structure
- **Compliance Framework**: Self-contained with placeholder for Team 2 enhancements

#### 🔄 Ready for Integration:
- **Team 3 Browser Automation**: Interface defined, decorators ready
- **Future Teams**: MCP protocol fully implemented, tools exposed

### 🚀 Server Capabilities

#### Supported Features:
- Recipe extraction with structured data
- URL validation for supported sites
- Daily usage tracking and rate limiting
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Session management for tracking
- Error handling with detailed responses

#### Current Site Support:
- **NYT Cooking**: Full extraction support (requires subscription)
- **Extensible**: Framework ready for additional recipe sites

### 🔧 Usage Examples

#### Start MCP Server:
```python
from recipe_mcp import RecipeMCPServer
import asyncio

async def main():
    server = RecipeMCPServer(headless=True, debug=False)
    await server.start()
    # Server ready for MCP tool calls

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Extract Recipe with Compliance:
```python
# Automatic compliance checking
result = await extract_recipe({
    "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1234-example",
    "include_nutrition": True,
    "timeout": 30
})

print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Daily usage: {result.compliance_info.daily_usage_count}/50")
```

### 📁 File Structure Impact

```
recipe_mcp/
├── __init__.py           # ✏️  Updated exports with compliance classes
├── models.py             # 🔄 Complete rewrite with compliance integration  
├── server.py             # 🔄 Enhanced with 4 MCP tools + compliance
├── extractor.py          # ✏️  Updated for new Recipe model structure
├── compliance.py         # ✨ NEW: Complete compliance framework
└── tests/
    └── test_models.py    # 🔄 Updated for new model structure
```

### 🎯 Next Steps for Team Coordination

#### For Team 3 (Browser Automation):
1. Use `@ensure_compliance()` decorator on extraction functions
2. Integrate `ComplianceHTTPSession` for HTTP requests  
3. Return `ExtractionResult` objects with compliance info
4. Test against daily limits and rate limiting

#### For Integration Testing:
```bash
# Verify MCP server functionality
python -c "
from recipe_mcp import RecipeMCPServer
from recipe_mcp.compliance import get_compliance_status
import asyncio

async def test():
    server = RecipeMCPServer()
    status = await get_compliance_status()
    print(f'Server ready: {status}')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```
